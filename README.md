Homework Assignment: Building a Simple Angular App with Product and Tag Management



In this homework assignment, you will create a basic Angular web application that allows users to manage a list of products and associated tags. The application will consist of two main components: a product list page, a product detail page, and functionality to create, update, and delete products and tags. Users should also be able to filter products by tags.



Assignment Requirements:



1. Setup Angular Environment:

   Set up a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.
   Create a Git repository for your project.


2. Create Product and Tag Components:

Create components for displaying the product list and product detail.
Create components for managing tags.


3. Product List Page:

Display a list of products with their basic information (e.g., name, description, price).
Include a button to create a new product.
Implement a feature to delete a product from the list.


4. Product Detail Page:

Clicking on a product in the list should navigate to a product detail page.
Display all details of the selected product.
Include an "Edit" button to update the product's information.
Implement a feature to delete the selected product.


5. Create and Update Products:

Create a form for adding new products with fields such as name, description, price, and tags.
Implement form validation for the product creation/update forms.
Create a form for editing existing products.
Handle the submission of the forms to add or update products.


6. Tag Management:

Implement functionality to create, edit, and delete tags.
Tags can have a name and color (for visual distinction).
Allow associating tags with products (e.g., assign one or more tags to a product).


7. Filter Products by Tags:

On the product list page, provide a way to filter products by tags.
Implement filter functionality to display products based on selected tags.
Include a way to clear the tag filter.


8. Routing:

Use Angular routing to navigate between the product list, product detail, and tag management pages.


9. Styling:

Apply basic CSS styling to make your application visually appealing.
Ensure a responsive design for different screen sizes.


10. Documentation:

Write a README file with clear instructions on how to run and test your application.


11. Bonus (Optional):

Implement user authentication and user-specific product management (e.g., users can only edit their own products).
Use a UI library or framework (e.g., Angular Material) for enhanced design and user experience.


Submission:

Share the GitHub repository link containing your Angular project.
Include a brief explanation of your code structure and any notable decisions you made during the development.


Grading:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the completeness of the requirements, code quality, user interface, and overall functionality of the application. Make sure to follow best practices for Angular development and provide clean, well-documented code.




# AngularHomework

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
